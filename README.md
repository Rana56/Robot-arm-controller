# Robot-arm-controller
This project is a program that allows the user to control a robot arm through a graphical user inteface. It is created using python, kivy python framework and arduino code. The robot is comprised of servo motors that are connected to an arduino board that sends pwm signals to the motors and controls it.

The user can control the robot through the use of on-screen sliders or program the robot itself and run it. If a user programms the robot, the code is processed using a queue and execued accordingly.
